    "about": "The Museum is a first of it's kind in Nepal (and dare we say, even the world). Not only are all our six distinct rooms/apartments culturally immersive but interactive as well. In collaboration with our partner company, Backstreet Academy, we've picked up six different crafts that culturally embedded in Nepali society and designed our apartments around them. Namely, woodwork, stone carving, Madal instrument, Thangka paintings, pottery and Khukuri (steel blades of the famed Gurkha warriors).The spaceA master craftsperson has taken responsibility of each apartment/room to display his uniquely hand-crafted work, and what makes our apartments special is you can meet and attend the workshops (all under 5 hours) of any of these craftsperson to truly culturally immerse yourself with the theme of your room. Or if you'd like you can also directly purchase the products of these craftsmen and avoid the overpriced souvenirs sold in the markets. This apartment in particular has undertones of a stone mason's home and has the works displayed of Hom Basnet, a stone mason the likes of whom have builtthe ancient cities of Kathmandu.The building itself was builtover 30 years ago as a residential property, but we've renovated it to serve as a one-of-a-kind Bed & Breakfast. We also have a farmers market that's held in our gardens every Saturday from 7am to 1pm.  ",

A personal heater was provided but apparently having the heater on for long was a safety hazard as said by Chhapeji.  ",

They'll really take care of you. Amrit knows the best places to find the right things in the city – momos, thongba, friendly pubs, art, meat, traditional things, monasteries – and all the inside information. He's also got an enviable collection of books, art and curios all over the house. And some evenings, lovely Nepali music. And there's so many birds to see from the balconies! (Amrit can ID most of these for you, but don't trust him on the names of stars.) We stayed a week here, but wanted some more. The house is a very short taxi ride from MG Marg, and the taxi stop is right around the corner. If you go during the right season, Amrit's garden will be bursting with fruits and vegetables.

From the pickup at the airport to the check-in, up until the moment of picking up our bags at the end of our stay, everything was absolutely phenomenal. The property itself was beautiful. A wonderful mix of greenery and traditional wooden structure, we could not have asked for a better stay. The rooms were very spacious, and we especially loved the second floor outdoor lounging area! Perfect place to get together with your group before you go back inside your rooms or leave for the day. The location was great, just minutes away from the Chiang Mai Gate, and within all the designated pick-up areas for my adventures. I walked from the gate to the house alone at night and feltvery safe. It's also in a very residential part, slightly away from all the action (but close enough to walk to the action), which was great as we didn't have to deal with any noise at night.I do need to give a shout-out to the breakfast! I opted for breakfast every day of my trip, and it was so delicious I still dream aboutit. The food itself was absolutely phenomenal, and the team that prepared it were such great wholesome people! My elephant sanctuary pickup came a little earlier than expected, and the team made sure I had enough food with me so I wouldn't be hungry (and I was so happy they did because otherwise I would've been so hungry throughout the day).Also another shoutout for Mo and Ton and the team for being the most helpful and wonderful hosts anyone could ask for! Even from before my trip, they helped me with reservations for all of my adventures, and during the trip whenever I had any questions they were so quick to respond, I never feltconfused or lost.  ",

It has a study table and amazing books to read. The hosts live in the same vicinity and are quite reachable. Honestly, you would even feel the need to reach out to them, they are very proactive and understanding. They will offer you chai multiple times and would make sure you are having a comfortable stay. The food here is no fuss home-cooked delicious food. The best part is that the hosts will eat with you. Maya's husband works at a post office in Mukteshwar and he walks half the way there daily. So you can accompany him for a walk till Muksteshwar whenever you want. You need to take a shared cab to a village called 'Shitla' and then walk all the way to Mukteshwar. It's a 4-5kms hike one way. Have some breakfast at Mukteshwar and then he will accompany you back to the homestay after finishing his work. He usually takes an hour to finish his work. Overall, I had an amazing stay at Maya's homestay and would strongly recommend you to book this property.  ",

Vicky Manchanda (9897255020) the resident taxi extraordinaire collected us from the station and helped us/  guided us / befriended us / provided us with contacts at our next destination (Jaipur).. his brother Mirza too.. consider hiring his taxi for the day for circa R1500.. it takes the stress out of getting around town. The Homestay supper was first class. Anan and Lena both helped and recommended places (The Grand Gopika Thali restaurant was were the local families went to eat and fantastic value / the Pinch of Spice more touristy but very good). It was an easy walk to the Taj Mahal (try the gardens near the taj .. a great view ) - the view from the roof terrace of the Homestay was incredible. Well worth the little extra compared with other airbnb places. One thing to be aware of .. it is very easy to lock your partner in the bathroom / room with the door bolts on the outside... but her cries for help are quickly heard :). If you are short of time Agra can be done in 2 days unless you are intending to travel around / outside the town.  ",

    "about": "The Living Woods- Red Royal Wooden Bide.This is a retreat in the middle of an apple orchard, 25 km beyond Shimla. Our cottage and Villa are newly builtretreat in Cheog, Himachal.It's a perfect blend of village life, apple trees, the whistling pines. The only sound one could hear is of the chirping of birds, an occasional vehicle and some one and a half dogs.Summers are pleasant though winters are cold. It can snow anytime from Mid December- March. Snowfall can be mild to heavy.The spaceRed Royal Wooden Bide.It's a brand new property having 3 single room cottages with attached toilets , a separate  dining hall  ( pretty spacious) with kitchen attached.Fresh and hot,home made, food is served, on advance intimation.Breakfast will be served between 8.30 am to 10am.

If you happen to be at our place during the apple season, you will see trees laden with apples all over the property.You will witness the entire orchard blooming with  blossoms in the first week of April. The sight is not only pleasing to the eye but also symbolises  new beginning and announces the commencement of Spring. The brief beauty of petals is really a sight to see. It carries a very subtle, soft ,sweet and floral scent. The light breeze helps odour molecules travel !To add to this, one can see  the bumble bees and hear their buzzing sound. Not to miss out on the honey bees and their humming sounds and differently coloured, butterflies ! All these help in pollination !!!Apples normally mature within 130- 150 days  after the full bloom stage, depending on the variety grown. One can see the apples grow in various sizes anytime from  Mid April till the harvesting season  which begins from Mid August and lasts till aboutthe last week of September. You could witness the plucking of apples, grading and packing them in the boxes. We have two machans where one can  sit and bask in the sun. Sip in a  beer or two. Have a soft drink or a juice.Parking is available inside the property.Our apple orchard is surrounded by dense deodar forest with no immediate neighbors. The best part of staying here is that it re - connects with nature. You are away from the distractions of daily life, yet close enough to the main town of Shimla to not feel too disconnected. It is best suited for people who prefer serenity, isolation, privacy, nature and tranquility. Locals here engage in intensive apple and vegetable farming. Respecting local sentiments will be highly appreciated. Though the place has no immediate neighbors, sound does travel fast and clear in a place where one can hear chirping of birds and whistling of the pines quite distinctly. Thus, loud music or loud noises, which may disturb the locals, will not be appreciated, specially in the night.The village market is just about500 meters away and has good 25 odd shops, SBI bank, ATM, couple of Chemists and a doctor's clinic. There is also a government ayurvedic hospital and a Higher Secondary School. If you are a keen walker and love nature walks, you can go for treks ( short or long ) around the property or just stroll around to enjoy the flora and the scenic beauty.We have board games like, ludo, chess, tambola, scrabble, carrom for your enjoyment.One can enjoy bonfire facility, at an additional cost, under the clear sky.Barbeque facility is available at the property, at an additional cost. .

Tip - don’t miss the yummy butter chicken and ghee shakkar dessert. The dining area was designed so thoughtfully, with beautiful crockery and a great sit-down experience. The Chadha family are not only great hosts but also great company. We had some of the most interesting conversations over our meals with them. If you think of unwinding and having a peaceful experience, this is the place. From the garden swing in the morning, to snoozing on the hammock at noon, to the machan for chai/a drink, it’s everything you can dream of!The hiking trails around the property are great to explore in the morning with fresh air to breathe and greenery galore.If you’re planning a trip to Himachal, this is a must-do.

The rooms and washrooms were sparkling clean which we loved as it's rare to find clean places these days. The bedwere comfortable and we had access to two open huge balconies for morning teas and evening night conversations and walk. Food is a way to human's heart - they touched our hearts with the food they served. We had all our breakfast and dinner at the stay. One night they served the local food and it was finger licking good. We were two families, with two kids and we all enjoyed and feltrelaxed during our stay. Families who enjoy open spaces and terraces, this place is perfect. Folks who like local cuisine and home food, this is the place to stay.

Your host Anshuman Ji is very warm person and always available for anything you need. This is a perfect location to stay from hustle bustle of city life. There are some good treks that you can plan. We could only go to Chamunda Mata temple trek, which is near the village and on top of mountain. This place could be you base for Dalhousie, Khajjiar and other treks.Anshuman Ji and his family are perfect host. My son enjoyed Sachit's  (Anshuman's son) company a lot. Just knowing that my son's birthday is during our stay he planned a surprised birthday celebration. If I don't mention aboutthe food then this reviewwill not be complete. They have prepared delicious food for us. Taste and aroma were unmatched for all the dishes. I can confidently say this is my best homestay so far and Anshuman Ji is best host. I only have option to give 5 start, for me this is a 10 star homestay.  ",

His home is clean and spacious. It is in a very good location. His family is warm and welcoming. The room has all the little touches a traveller appreciates. The whole living space was very clean and well maintained. There is a seperate kitchen that is provided for guests to use. He left a box of muffins and some snacks in the room for us in case we got hungry.. we do appreciated the touch, not to mention that the muffins (home baked) were awesome. We opted for an Indori breakfast and were not disappointed! Amit is trained chef with years of experience and hence loads of knowledge and stories! If food is your thing, you will definitely not be disappointed with the conversations had there. We loved staying there and would definitely be back. We recommend anyone to book his place without a second thought.  ",

Communication :  As soon as we booked, Amit immediately got in communication with us providing us details of the accommodation, address, directions etc.  Upon request he even helped us with suggestions (like a family member would do)on how we can get to Ujjain from the Indore airport.  This was even before we reached him.  After we reached his place on day 2 of our trip, he was in constant communication whether it was suggestions on the best places to visit for sightseeing, shopping or food  OR organising transport for our daytrip to Maheshwar etc !!Rooms and amenities:  Amit's home is in a nice quiet locality.  Very clean rooms and smelling really good!  Room decor, linen was good.  amenitiessuch as complementary coffee, tea, basic toast etc, in addition to use of a Fridge if required.  There are multiple books on Amit's interest 'FOOD'!!Food :  We were welcomed with very good tea!.  Our stay was short and most of which was outside Amit's place and therefore we did not get a chance to check out Amit's full range of culinary skills!!  However we had the best Poha and Kachori's for breakfast!!  The welcome goodies such as Namkeens and cupcakes were really good as well!  Hospitality :  5 Stars for the hospitality!  It was better than staying with our own family!  Value for money :  Cost of the property is a steal for the above amenitiesand most importantly the hospitality!  GO FOR IT!!  ",

The hosts - Moxa, Anshu, Achintya and the resident doggo Olive - are very warm and welcoming. We loved getting to know them. They went above and beyond to make our stay enjoyable - a) they served us delicious and generous portions of meals and snacks (they have an elaborate menu and all items are prepared with care), b) they suggested plenty of things we could do in and around the area, such as short trips and food suggestions, which were very useful, c) they recommended great nearby hikes and took us on a particularly beautiful one too - definitely a trip highlight.

We were accorded a traditional welcome by Mamta.After that, it was like a home, away from home. They took care of all our needs and made us feel like family. The huts that we stayed in were made in the traditional style with mud and thatched roof. It was really cool inside inspire of the heat outside.Don't expect it to be very spacious as it stays true to the design of the original huts that the locals live in. The bedare comfortable with clean linen. There is a fan and an air-cooler. We never got around to using the air cooler as the fan was sufficient. The tiled bath was clean, with a wash basin, shower, Western commode, Health shower, toilet paper, Soap and towels. Hot water was available at all times. Food was excellent. We got to cook and eat with the family. The food is authentic local cuisine like the locals have. Simple and tasty.Mamta taught us how to make the local bajri ki roti which an Indian bread made of Pearl Millet, which is a staple in the area. Her Ginger tea is really delicious and refreshing.Chottaram took us on a tour to a Bishnoi community village and to a Potter's house, where we got to spin the wheel and make a pot.We went on a drive looking for desert Wildlife. We were lucky to spot some Nilgai (this is the largest Asian antelope), herds of Black Buck, a Vulture, a wild boar and Peacocks. Enroute we stopped by a lake where a huge herd of sheep and a camel were being herded by a shepherd. It was indeed a magnificent sight.If you want to experience the rustic real world of rural Rajasthan, I would recommend this home stay. You would come back feeling richer with the experience and also making some friends.  ",

This family leads a cooperative of rug weavers and the sense of community really is all around, it was special to experience this. In the same spirit, Chotaram designed a village tour where he takes you to visit potters, textile embroiderers, a bisnoi family and even spotting wild animals like a safari where he shares the tour fee with the families. We also got to see how the dhurry rugs are weaved on a traditional loom. In general we learned a lot aboutdaily life, Chotaram is happy to spend time with his guests and knows very good English.

Breakfast is included with the room rate. They can make all the Nepali standards quite tasty and get ingredients fresh. They were able to accommodate my raging vegetarianism as well. Can't beat the rate either (I paid ~$300 for 2 weeks).The owner/manager is Aditya and he lives in the building with family as well. He is very helpful and accommodating - he got me a good rate on a mountain bike rental and let me beat him at Fifa one night (there - now it's enshrined in Google for posterity!)  ",
